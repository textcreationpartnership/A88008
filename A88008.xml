            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE having observed with much sorrow and grief of heart, the sinful Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given to our late Parliament, by part of the Army of <hi>England,</hi> for near six years together: and yet after some smiting of Conscience on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptors, forcing them to restore the Banished of the Lord; who as the righteous Judge of all the Earth, having out of their own mouths, made them to condemn themselves; and withal, to take shame and confusion of face for that so abhorred an Act: who as thinking it too little for a Closet Duty, seem'd to sound a trumpet of repentance to the world; to shew in Print how vile &amp; abominable they were, or at least, seemed to be in their own eyes, for their backslidings from that Authority God had so eminently owned against all their enemies; and yet notwithstanding they having returned again to the same sin, by this late reiterated Interruption, heightned by many other grievous aggravations; by Addresses, Supscriptions, receiving their Commissions from them as their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to whom in Duty and Conscience they were therefore (in all relations, Sacred, Civil, and Military) bound to submit; yet as persons that were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to sin themselves alone, but desirous to make all the three Armies equally guilty, enforcing Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon them, thereby to justifie those perpetrated
<pb facs="tcp:168758:3"/>abominations of their Tyrannical Sword; assuming the Power as Legislators, to make Null Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: And the better to effect their Designe upon us, having prepared their way, by an unparallell'd Act of Violence; by casting out above two hundred Officers, without any tryal, under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: The worst of which durst not but have detested their Crimes; and who (if they had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) would have opposed them to the utmost: By all which proceedings, our Religion and Liberties, as Englishmen and Protestants, were subjected to the Lusts of men; as we could not but fly from the Tents of such Sons of Violence, lest some sudden and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable judgement should overtake us, as we fear, and are perswaded will them; they being guilty of no less then the sins of <hi>Corah;</hi> and therefore may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in his <hi>Gain-saying:</hi> So neither could we but be zealously enflamed, to hazard our Lives, Estates, and therewith our Posterities, rather then die a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring death, to see the Funeral of them all: And in this our resolution, observing the <hi>Becks</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> the Lord seemed to cast before our eyes, who in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy remembers us in our low estate, blessing our poor and sincere undertakings here.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Tuesday</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>December,</hi> we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted at five a Clock in the Evening, the seizing on the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the principal Magazine of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:168758:3"/>on which depended the coming or standing out of the whole Nation; and by the good hand of God, were made successful therein; which is therefore now at the Service of the Parliament, against Apostatized Usurpers.</p>
            <p>The Designe was near two moneths in contriving and the more dangerous, because of five Foot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies that Quartered in the City, but one of which we could repose any confidence in; neither durst we discover the thing, but only to one Officer of that Company; so that when it came to the execution, we were not assured of one man that would stand by us: But who shall despise the Day of small Things: Gods Judgements are swift, when Iniquity is full: Of three Troops of Horse, we made some of the Officers: And notwithstanding the length of time in projecting, yet we could not agree about timing the action for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till the night before; In all which, we finde very much of the <hi>Favouring Presence</hi> of God, That every mans part of the Design did hit so sure, that nothing failed, blessed be his name, whose Spirit moves within the wheels. The only covert for this action which providentially was made use of, was our meeting to promote a Petition in the Army to call a General Council; which so dazeled the eyes of our aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Commander in Chief, with several others of
<pb facs="tcp:168758:4"/>his Cabinet Confidents, that they expected nothing else to be intended. But that which sets out the mercy to be the greater, was, that not one drop of blood was shed. We have seized upon Col. <hi>Jones,</hi> then Commander in Chief, as a Prisoner, whose acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been such, that deservedly call him to the Bar of Justice, when ever it shall please God to bring the Parliament together. Such a strange Apostasie appeared amongst the Chief Officers of this Army, that of all the Colonels by whom the late Petition of the Army was generally condemned but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was soon after in another garb justified and promoted; and no sooner was Lieut. Gen. <hi>Ludlow</hi> landed in <hi>England,</hi> by whom they had Signed an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to the Parliament, but the very next Post bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing News of what the Army had done against them, they so generally faced about to justifie the Army, that only Maj. G. <hi>Waller,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charls Coot,</hi> and the L. of <hi>Broghill</hi> refused such a Subscription; and though but a day before it had been the highest crime to speak against the Parliament, yet the next day it was little less then Treasonable Dis-affection to speak for them. If therefore such men who turned out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were faithful to the Parliament, under the Notion of persons that could not be trusted, should now be kept in, we dread to think of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and therefore we hope, as there is a price
<pb facs="tcp:168758:4"/>put into your hands, so you will not want hearts to improve it, by justifying us, in purging your Army from such men, who like <hi>Balaam,</hi> love the wages of unrighteousness, whilst to the dishonour of the Name of God, and his Ways, they pretend the height of Profession, without which no visible way appeared to preserve the Parliaments Authority: Thursday following being the fifteenth, the City drew forth, and with much affection, and the highest expression of joy, declared with us; and though they had not eight hours notice, there appeared above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, besides Horse. This little spark hath ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen into such a flame, that in less then a weeks time, we finde upon the coming in of the Country Posts, by Letters, that <hi>Limrick, Galloway, Clonmel, Youghal, Ross, Kilkenny, Drogheda, Dundalk, Antrim,</hi> with mary other places, have already declared their concurrence with us; and we doubt not, but by the next, the rest of the Garrisons in <hi>Ireland</hi> will do the like. The Commissioners of the Parliament who lately entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themselves, Commissioners of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, are resolved not to Act, though the necessity be never so great, till <hi>Jones</hi> be at liberty; which is not thought fit to be permitted. Had not the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness taken at the very time it did, several of us had been seized upon the next day, meerly as dis-affected persons; a Letter having been sent from the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:168758:5"/>
               <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to <hi>Jones,</hi> to that purpose: Since things therefore are come to this Issue, and that to preserve the Parliaments Cause against the Army, we cannot in all things be so regular as we desire to be, through the refusal of the Commissioners to Act, yet we hope our actions being such as shall answer a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and meerly what necessity enforced us unto, you will make the best construction of them. By Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>England,</hi> we cannot but take notice of the carriage of Lieut. Gen. <hi>Ludlow</hi> in this Revolution; who having an opportunity to return hither, or there appear for the Parliament, yet hath not made use of it towards their Restitution as he might have done; We finde by the same Letter, that his dis-affection begins to be salved; and therefore how unsafe it is to confide in him; when what his Civils allow, his Conscientials destroy; we humbly refer to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration: We rest</p>
